🎵 Python Music Player with Database Integration

This project is a console-based Music Player application developed using Python, Pygame, and MySQL. It allows users to manage and play audio tracks stored in a database, providing essential music player features such as play, pause, resume, shuffle, and favorites management.

The application connects to a MySQL database to store song details and user preferences, ensuring persistent data storage. It uses the Pygame mixer module to handle audio playback efficiently.
